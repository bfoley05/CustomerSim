Project Title: MP3 The Waiting Game

Overview:
MP4's goal is to simulate the income of students into a service center based on how much time they need to spend at each office and the order they come in. At this center the are assigned the order of order of offices to go to and the time they will spend at each along with their start time. We simulate this and output the idle times of the windows, and wait times of customers.

Commands to Execute:
    g++ *.cpp -o main
